HTML/CSS File:
Create the Title of the page 
Created Squares that are responsive to page size(also the device) with flex methods
Created the Buttons with Unique Id's to identify with the EventListener in JS file
Page background appeal to all Math lovers with an image of teacher in front of a board full of equations

JS File:
I created the function to randomly assign numbers to certain elements of the mathematical equations
I then provide The formulas to enable javascript to derive the answer to the question it populates on the page
Last but not least I use the getElementById and onclick methods to make the buttons created in the HTML file responsive to user interaction
the alert method and the use of conditional logic enables the UI to inform the user when he/she is correct, and in the event that the user is wrong it sometimes provides the correct response!

Instructions:
